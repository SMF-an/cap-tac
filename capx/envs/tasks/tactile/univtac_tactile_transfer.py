You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Goal: move two objects into their slots, strictly in order:
  1. Pick up object_a and place it into slot_a.
  2. Pick up object_b and place it into slot_b.
Both objects must end up resting in their slots for the task to succeed.

Key rules:
- Work on object_a first.  Touching object_b before object_a is released in
  slot_a fails the task.
- object_b sits inside a recessed compartment with walls around it — that
  compartment is NOT its slot.  slot_b is the open pad next to the
  compartment.  Reach in from above and grasp object_b normally.
- Place both objects by the placement recipe in the tactile skills at the end
  of this prompt. What is scored is where each one ends up.

Write ONLY executable Python code (no code fences). Import numpy if needed.
