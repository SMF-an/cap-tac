PROMPT = """
You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Task: tactile memory matching.  Three identical orange cans (lying flat on 
the table) sit in a line: one REFERENCE can at the back, two CANDIDATE cans 
in front of it (candidate_left on the left, candidate_right on the right).  
A green MATCH SLOT lies beside the row. The four are addressed by name:
reference_object, candidate_left, candidate_right and match_slot.

The cans look exactly the same but differ physically in three independent
ways: 2 surface textures x 2 weights x 2 hardnesses (one rigid, one
compliant).  One candidate is the reference's "twin" (identical in all
three); the other differs in at least one of them.  Your job:

  1. Measure all three properties of the reference from one progressive
     position-commanded grasp, following the one-grasp protocol in the
     tactile skills at the end of this prompt.
  2. Probe both candidates with the exact same one-grasp protocol.
  3. Place on the MATCH SLOT the candidate whose feel is closest to the
     reference.  Vision cannot tell them apart — decide ONLY from tactile
     data.

Write ONLY executable Python code (no code fences). Import numpy if needed.

    """The cross-seed trace experiment on tactile_memory_match.

    The task's own difficulty is the protocol, not one number: the reference
    and both candidates have to be probed, and the match is decided by
    comparing three properties of three cans.

    The delivered set is the readings this task needs: the one-grasp protocol
    with its two commanded closes (``memory-match-one-grasp``), the texture
    split (``can-texture-difference``, 0.02), the load channel
    (``follow-is-signal``), and the position-mode caveat that makes the two
    closes comparable (``position-mode-for-yield``).  The generic depth scale
    and the channel rule are not readings this task needs, so they are not
    delivered.

    ``gel-shear-weight`` is also withheld.  This task's weight axis is read
    from the can's own z -- ``follow`` (how far it rode the lift) and
    ``sag_mm`` (its stick-slip spread while suspended).  The shear difference
    is not a feature of this task's scorer at all (``DIMENSION_AXES``), so
    delivering the shear rule would teach a read that does not decide anything
    here, and it contradicts ``follow-is-signal`` in the same block.

    What is left to learn is the procedure that surrounds the measurement:
    how to reach each can, how to carry it, where to set it down, and how to
    know the placement took.  The old library has no ``place`` family and no
    approach rules.
