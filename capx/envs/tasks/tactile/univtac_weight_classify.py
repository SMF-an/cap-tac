PROMPT = """
You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Goal: exactly ONE block is standing on the table. Decide by touch whether it is
light or heavy, then place it on the matching plate:
  - Light block -> the blue_plate
  - Heavy block -> the yellow_plate

In the scene the block is named "block" and the plates "blue_plate" and
"yellow_plate" - use those exact names with the pose and grasp helpers.

The catch: the other block is parked a metre away, out of reach, so there is no
reference object to compare against. The reading has to be absolute, taken the
same way every trial.

Your fingertips are the instrument: the weight is in the gel, not in how far
anything moved, and a single raw reading means nothing on its own. Which grip
to use, how to take the reading, and how to turn it into a weight are in the
tactile skills at the end of this prompt.

After classifying, carry the block to its plate. The placement recipe - how to
move a held block, where to stop, and whether to let go - is in those same
skills. This task is scored on where the block ends up: seat it on the right
plate, upright, and stop.

Final placement: within 4 cm horizontally and 1 cm vertically, upright within 15
degrees.

Write ONLY executable Python code (no code fences). Import numpy if needed.
