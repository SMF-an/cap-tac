PROMPT = """
You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Goal: Grasp the prism, use tactile sensing to determine whether its surface
texture is rough or smooth, and gently place it on the matching pad:
  - Rough texture -> the orange_pad
  - Smooth texture -> the green_pad

In the scene the prism is named "prism" and the pads "orange_pad" and
"green_pad" - use those exact names with the pose and grasp helpers.

Your fingertips are the instrument: texture is the gel's marker-image
anisotropy, and its size tracks how hard the gel is pressed - so it is read as
the change between two commanded grips, never as one reading. Which channel,
which two grips, and the value to split them at are in the tactile skills at
the end of this prompt.

After classifying, carry the prism to its pad. The placement recipe - how to
move a held object, where to stop, and whether to let go - is in those same
skills. This task is scored on where the prism ends up: on the right pad,
upright, and stop.

Final placement: within 2 cm horizontally and 1 cm vertically, upright within 15
degrees.
