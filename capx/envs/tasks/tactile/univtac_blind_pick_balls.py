You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Goal: an open-topped box stands in front of the robot holding twelve balls of
three kinds -- hard, soft and textured, four of each -- resting on its floor
below the rim. Take one textured ball out of the box and release it in the
bowl beside it.

The box and the bowl are fixed. Inside, the box measures 0.36 m along x by
0.48 m along y, centred on x = 0.51, y = 0.00; the rim top is at z = 0.19 m and
the floor inside at z = 0.016 m. Every ball is a sphere of 30 mm base radius,
so a resting ball's centre is at z = 0.050 m. Balls sit on three rows at
y = -0.115, 0.000 and 0.115 m. Nothing says which ball is where: no camera
sees into the box and no API reading reports a ball's position, so the pads
are the only sensor.  Read them with describe_tactile(); the description is
the only tactile reading this task gives you. The bowl is centred on x = 0.49, y = -0.34 m with a
radius of 75 mm, its wall rising to z = 0.051 m.

The episode ends by itself after about two minutes of simulated time, and
motion is what spends it: every move and every close costs, a pad read on a
still arm does not. One pass along the three rows is affordable; a second pass
is not.

A ball counts only if both pads are holding it while it is lifted clear of the
box and if it comes to rest inside the bowl. Releasing one in the bowl that is
not the right kind, or that the robot never actually lifted, ends the run.
Balls that turn out to be the wrong kind are better put back in the box.

# =============================================================================
# blind_pick_balls v1 -- rake the three public rows, measure the one channel
# that separates the materials, then lift and deliver.
#
# What this task gives the API and what it withholds decides the whole design:
#
#   * No object pose, no scene camera, no material label.  The pads are the
#     only sensor, and the task is scored on touch.
#   * No force channel and no contact-patch channel.  The upstream expert
#     locates a ball from its contact patch; that is not available here, so
#     every geometric fact below is either public (rows, box, ball radius),
#     derived from the arm's own kinematics, or measured.
#   * The gel depth is a millimetre-scale indentation reading, and the finger
#     opening is commanded in units of full open: 1.0 puts 80 mm between the
#     pad faces, i.e. 0.04 m of travel per jaw, so a face gap is 2 * q.
#
# The separating channel is the SHAPE of the imprint, not its depth.  Every
# scalar that averages over the gel -- depth, marker displacement, coherence,
# anisotropy -- follows how hard a pad is pressed, and across a whole scene
# none of them separated the dotted balls from the smooth ones.  A smooth ball
# imprints a clean spherical cap; a raised surface leaves its bumps behind.
# The reading is the RMS residual of a smooth quadratic contact envelope
# fitted to the indentation map -- the statistic the task's own expert uses.
# At a 48 mm seat gap the populations do not overlap.  Bench numbers over all
# twelve balls of one scene: smooth 0.016-0.027 mm (four rubber, four polymer),
# dotted 0.092-0.093 mm (four balls, eight measurements each way).  Those were
# taken at a 0.2 mm squeeze.  In the real search the seat bites 0.6-2.3 mm and
# every population moves up: over the balls one scene actually seated, smooth
# read 0.019-0.038 mm (polymer 0.019-0.029, rubber 0.038) and dotted
# 0.088-0.246 mm.  The bar sits at 0.06, between the two.
#
# The reading scales with how deep the seat bites: a dotted ball seated only
# 1.6 mm instead of the usual 1.8 read 0.040 mm, and in a lighter contact the
# separation collapses -- at the 58 mm rake gap dotted balls read 0.031-0.034
# and smooth 0.000-0.009, while the rake's own brushed contact reads
# 0.008-0.020 for dotted against 0.002-0.019 for rubber, fully overlapping.
# So there is one place worth measuring, the deep seat -- and the bar is set
# above the top of the smooth readings seen there, not low enough to survive a
# shallow seat.  The two mistakes cost different amounts: skipping a dotted
# ball only spends another rake step, while delivering a smooth one ends the
# run.
#
# Seating the ball and measuring it are one action: close to 48 mm, require
# both pads loaded, and read the relief.  A 60 mm ball cannot touch both pads
# from outside a 48 mm gap, so a bilateral load is proof the ball is between
# the pad faces -- and because relief describes the imprint rather than how
# deep the pads sit, the first pose that catches the ball is as good a place
# to grasp as any later one.
#
# A ball can also sit under one pad for every straddle.  That ball is not lost:
# the pads are only holding its rear cap, at the far end of a row where the arm
# can reach no further, and the close that follows drags it onto both faces --
# measured, a one-pad seat at 22 mm behind the ball closed to 8.8/8.5 N of
# face contact and scored.  What must NOT be done is to step the gripper
# sideways to "centre" it: at that depth into the ball no sideways pose loads
# both pads at all (left pad, then a dead band with neither, then right pad,
# 3 mm apart), and stepping into the dead band turns the same close into
# 0.04 N on one pad while its gel still reads 27 mm of indentation.  So the
# seat is left exactly where the close found it.
#
# One-pad evidence for the material is the weaker kind -- the dotted ball that
# read 0.085 that way is the case the bar admits, and the smooth one-pad
# readings measured so far top out at 0.027 -- so it has to clear the whole
# 0.06 bar alone rather than half of it.
#
# One refused move ends the task: it latches an internal failure that only a
# reset clears, and every later command silently does nothing.  The x cap at
# RAKE_X1 is therefore load-bearing, not cosmetic.  The arm physically stops
# near 0.642 m and refuses points past it; the upstream expert never scans
# beyond 0.630 m.
#
# Everything measured is printed.  The threshold is an estimate from the smooth
# balls; the log is the calibration data that pins it down.
