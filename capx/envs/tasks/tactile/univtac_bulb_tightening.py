PROMPT = """
You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Goal: screw the light_bulb into its socket until it is all the way in. In the
scene the bulb is named "light_bulb" - use that exact name with the pose and
grasp helpers.

The bulb starts already threaded into its socket, and it is a thread: turning
is the only thing that takes it deeper. Pushing it down does not move it - the
push is taken by the glass and the pads instead, and it stays there.

The fingertips are the instrument, not a safety net. The bulb is smooth glass
and the pads are the only thing that touches it, so every question this task
asks is answerable from them, and that is where the answers should come from:

- Which way is in. Take the direction from separate legs; how long each leg
  must be, and how far apart they have to come before you believe them, are in
  the tactile skills at the end of this prompt.
- How fast to descend. The lead is not given either, and it varies with the
  bulb, so it has to be measured rather than assumed - and the pads are what
  measure it. The skills below give the method.
- Whether it is in. The seat is a reading, not a count of turns, and the skills
  below say when it can be believed.

The wrist runs out of range soon after a third of a turn, so a full insertion
is several segments with the hand re-set in between. Going past that range is
refused outright and is not recoverable within the episode, so keep the
segments well short of it; the skills below give the reset sequence and say
when to stop re-setting.

The job is done the moment the bulb is all the way in: there is nothing to
submit and nothing to hold at the end, so stop turning there and let the
episode be scored on the bulb.

Write ONLY executable Python code (no code fences). Import numpy if needed.

# --- Bringing the feed onto the pitch -----------------------------------------
#
# Correcting a block at a time was v11's mistake: the per-block slide scatters
# with sigma ~0.03 mm = 0.12 mm/turn at 30 deg, nearly three per cent of a pitch,
# and a damped servo chasing that walks.  Seed 1's walked -- 2.1 per cent under
# the pitch, then 9.9 over, 16 of its 41 blocks pinned on LEAD_TRUE_MIN_MM.
#
# The pitch is a property of the grasp, so it is read per grasp, cumulatively:
# inside one 120 deg grasp the hand is never re-set, so nothing but the thread
# moves the glass and the grasp's whole gain over its whole descent IS the pitch.
#
#     lead = (sum of gain) * 360 / (sum of degrees)
#
# 90 deg of sum instead of 30 cuts the scatter by about three, so one grasp gives
# ~5 per cent and nine give ~1.7 -- nothing for a damping factor to do.  Seed 1
# settles inside 1.5 per cent of its 4.3623 and stays there.
#
# The grasp's first block is left out: every re-grasp drags the glass back through
# the pads a little (seed 1's nine re-grasps averaged -0.044 mm there against
# +0.006, -0.001, -0.003 for the other three positions).  That costs ~1.4 per
# cent low, the safe side to be wrong on -- a feed UNDER the pitch lets the thread
# lead the hand, while a feed OVER it holds the glass back by a fixed amount every
# block, and that standing gap is what the seat test looks for.
#
# Deliberately NOT gated on coherence: confidence collapses for a grasp or two
# after every re-grasp (seed 1 ran 0.15-0.45 for most of the insertion), so a

# of it, calling the seat with the bulb 3.0 mm into a 13 mm travel.
#
# 0.10, not v11's 0.5.  Seed 1 measured the seat directly -- block 40, the first
# block the torque moved on, -0.043 mm of slide against a 0.356 mm commanded
# descent = 0.122; seed 3 put the same event at 0.14.  Near a tenth because the
# seat's slide scales with the block's descent rather than being a fixed length.

# bound it from either side, and both are in hand millimetres:
#
# Above it, the first grasp turns at the probe's 11.1 mm/turn, and an over-lead
# block slides the pads at a fraction of its own descent that looks exactly like
# a seat -- so the arm has to clear the whole of that grasp: 120 deg at 11.1 is
# 3.7 mm of hand whatever the thread does.
#
# Below it, the bulb is home when the HAND has sunk the probe's 3.7 mm plus the
# travel at a matched feed -- 7.5 mm on the deepest sampled lead (7.935 mm,
# home at 6.5 mm of bulb) and 8.8 mm on the shallowest (4.271).  Arming at or
# past that leaves no block to read the seat on.
#
# 5.5 sits between the two with a block or two of margin either way.  It used to

    ``bulb-grasp-pose`` tells the run to ask ``sample_grasp_pose`` for the
    bulb's grasp pose after every re-grasp, and that recipe is the server's
    ground-truth branch (``_GT_GRASP_RULES``, ``launch_univtac_server.py``).
    The perception API class turns that branch off (``_ground_truth_grasp =
    False``), so on this line the same call hands back the hand's own parked
    pose instead of the bulb's -- the 2026-10-05 failure, where the grasp
    landed 63 mm off the bulb and closing on air ended the episode.  The
    config that uses this class carries the perception-side grasp recipe in
    its own ``prompt:`` block instead.

    The tuple is the library's bulb routing minus that one skill.  It is
    written out rather than derived so the delivered set can be read off the
    class; `test_the_only_hook_override_is_the_perception_bulb_variant`
    fails if the two sets ever drift apart.
