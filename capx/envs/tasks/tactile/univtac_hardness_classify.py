PROMPT = """
You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Goal: exactly ONE red block is standing on the table. Decide by touch whether
it is soft or hard, then place it on the matching plate:
  - Soft block -> the blue_plate
  - Hard block -> the yellow_plate

In the scene the block is named "block" and the plates "blue_plate" and
"yellow_plate" - use those exact names with the pose and grasp helpers.

The catch: the other block is parked a metre away, out of reach, so there is no
reference object to compare against. The reading has to be absolute, taken the
same way every trial.

Your fingertips are the instrument: hardness is how much of your grip the block
passes on to the gel, and it only shows up as the gel's response to a CHANGE in
grip force, never as the depth of one close. Which two grips to compare, how to
set the squeeze, and the value to split them at are in the tactile skills at the
end of this prompt.

After classifying, carry the block to its plate. The placement recipe - how to
move a held block, where to stop, and whether to let go - is in those same
skills. This task is scored on where the block ends up: seat it on the right
plate, upright, and stop.

Final placement: within 4 cm horizontally and 1 cm vertically, upright within 15
degrees.

Write ONLY executable Python code (no code fences). Import numpy if needed.
