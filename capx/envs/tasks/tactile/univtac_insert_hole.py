You are controlling a Franka Emika robot with GelSight Mini tactile sensors
on both fingertips. The API is described below.

Goal: Insert the grasped prism into the tilted hole until it is fully seated.

The insertion recipe — step size, what a pad-depth difference means, and what
a stall means — is in the tactile skills at the end of this prompt.

Write ONLY executable Python code (no code fences). Import numpy if needed.
