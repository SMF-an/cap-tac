"""Structured tactile trace: one JSONL row per reading, off by default.

Set ``CAPX_TACTILE_TRACE`` to a path and every call that brings tactile
readings home appends one row — what was called, with what arguments, and
every scalar the response carried.  A value with no suffix is treated as a
directory and gets ``tactile_trace.jsonl`` inside it (created on first row);
a value with a suffix is used as the file.  Unset means nothing is written.

Why a separate file exists at all: the printed ``Tactile:`` line is a
summary somebody chose, and what it left out is the half the retrieval work
needs.  The marker shear vector and the anisotropy were computed, sent over
HTTP, and then dropped on the floor, so a finished trial could not be read
back for the channels that separate a slip from a squeeze.  A row here is
the response itself, field for field, so a judgement made in one run can be
re-made — or re-made differently — in another.

Nothing is derived here.  No baseline subtraction, no phase label, no
distance from the gel face: a value computed at trace time becomes a
definition the next version has to keep agreeing with, and the point of
keeping the raw scalar is that later definitions stay free.  Rows are
appended, never rewritten, and are not rotated — a trial that polls tactile
in a loop will make a large file, which is the caller's decision to make.

Every row carries the trial it came from (see :func:`set_trial`), because a
run writes one file for all of them.  That column is what lets a finished
run be split into the trials that worked and the trials that did not.

Every row also carries the run it came from (:data:`RUN_ID`).  Rows are
appended and a re-run of a seed repeats the same trial numbers into the same
file, so the trial column on its own would read the second attempt as more
of the first — and if the two ended differently, as one trial that both
worked and did not.  The id is fixed when the process imports this module,
which is the grain the runner works at: one process executes one run.
