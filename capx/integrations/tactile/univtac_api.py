"""UniVTAC tactile manipulation API for LLM code generation.

Functions in this class are called directly by LLM-generated Python code
during trial execution.  Each function's docstring appears verbatim in the
LLM prompt (via :meth:`ApiBase.combined_doc`), so it describes what the
function and its arguments ARE: ranges, units, hard limits, and the fields
the return carries.  How to USE a function on a task -- which reading to
take, what to compare it against, which trap the obvious version falls
into -- is not written here.  That lives in the tactile memory
(``capx.tactile_memory``): the few principles that hold for this sensor ship
with the task prompt, and the mined cards are printed by ``get_tactile_data``
when the live reading matches them, so each rule has one owner instead of a
copy in every prompt.  Functions
listed in ``_prompt_hidden`` stay callable at execution time but are excluded
from the prompt (see ``check_success``).

All calls are forwarded to the UniVTAC API server over HTTP.

        contact hardens (see get_tactile_data).  Lower values grip firmer.

        With adaptive=True (the default) the close is judged by the gel depth
        it reached, so a close that meets nothing never reaches the target and

        stops short of the commanded opening raises, the message carrying the
        opening it landed on.  A raise is not a lost reading: the fingers stay

                micro-step onto the target and the released depth comes back

                measured around a 26.5 target — so check the reading against a
                narrow band rather than one exact value. It gives up on an

        """Read the GelSight Mini tactile sensors without moving.

        The readings are the same scalar set every motion primitive returns —
        this is the read that costs no motion.  The marker images are not
        returned by this call, only the scalars listed below.

        This is also the only call that consults the tactile memory: the
        reading is keyed, and any mined card whose situation it matches is
        printed under the scalars.  The key compares this reading with the
        previous one, so a card can be about a change ("the depth stopped
        falling") and not only about a state.  The return shape does not
        change — the line arrives in the output, the way every other API
        result does.

        Every numeric field below falls back to 0.0 when its sensor did not
        report.  0.0 is out of range for all of them, so a 0.0 means the
        reading is MISSING, not that it is zero — and a missing pad is not a
        zero pad: a dead left gel returns depth 0.0, which is past the hard
        stop and would read as the firmest grip on the scale if taken at face
        value.  Pair it with the contact flag, which is False on that same
        pad.  (marker_anisotropy is the exception: it comes back as None when
        there is no image to read.)

        Returns:
            dict with: left_contact, right_contact (bool — a RANGE flag, not
            a press: true as soon as any surface is inside the sensor's range,

            surface can still be up to ~5.6 mm short of the gel face.  Both
            up does not by itself mean the pads are touching the object);

            the nearest surface — 34 mm is the far plane (nothing in range);
            the gel's own face sits at ~28.3 mm undeformed, so a reading above
            that is a surface that has NOT reached the pad and one below it is
            pressed into the gel.  The reading DECREASES as contact hardens:
            ~27.8-29 mm is the gel-face band, where a light grasp and a
            close that met nothing both read — the contact flags are up in
            either case, and only the marker displacement separates them
            (under 0.01 px for the empty close; a real grasp moves them
            1.5 px or more.  A pad that has touched nothing still reports a
            few thousandths of a pixel, so test a threshold — anything
            above ~1 px is contact — and never "nonzero") — ~24 mm is the
            sensor's floor (the camera's window ends there), and the reading
            saturates there.  Returning to 34 mm
            means the pads are
            open, which is the same reading whether the object was never held,
            was set down, or was dropped — the field answers whether something
            is inside the sensor's range, never where it went);

            to motion overall, not a measure of how far the markers went:
            0.0 to 0.8 is ordinary on a pad that barely moved, whether at
            rest right after a close or on a turn that slid it almost
            nothing, and grasps that go on to work have read it there; a

            baseline — the part of the marker motion that the whole patch
            shares, so the direction is kept: a load hanging off the gel drags
            every marker one way (shear grows), while a uniform squeeze pushes
            them outward and its mean cancels.  The two sensors are mounted
            mirrored, so the SAME physical slide appears with OPPOSITE sign on

            sphere is a clean cap, while a raised surface leaves its bumps in
            the gel.  Every field above is an average over the gel, so it
            grows with how hard the pad is pressed; this one does not — at the
            same squeeze a smooth ball reads 0.02-0.03 mm and a dotted one
            0.09-0.25 mm while the pads sit on its centre — so it answers

        Slip is judged on how much the marker displacement has GROWN since the
        previous call: a real slip or jam shears the markers further in a
        uniform direction, so the displacement increases by more than
        threshold_px while coherence stays high.  A steady grasp — even one
        that already slipped earlier — does not re-report.  The FIRST call
        only establishes the reference reading (returns False), so the very
        first motion after it is never judged.

        Args:
            threshold_px: (float) Minimum displacement GROWTH in pixels since
                the previous call.  1.0 = sensitive, 5.0 = tolerant.

                (slip) from compression/deformation.

        feed_lead_m selects the implementation.  Omitted, the environment's
        expert rotate runs one planner sub-move per step and fails the call
        when the object turns by less than 30 % of the requested angle (or
        about 3 deg, whichever is larger).
        Given, zero included, each step is one differential-IK iteration that
        turns the object by angle_rad / steps and advances the hand by the
        matched feed; the twist and the advance stay locked together.  This
        servo path needs the task's own _ik_to_center servo — without it the
        call is refused.

        One servo iteration carries about 4.6 deg of joint motion, so a step
        count too coarse for the angle is raised rather than refused:
        "requested" can exceed the number passed.  An unreachable target (a
        wrist limit, say) refuses the call, and that refusal latches the
        task's failure flag for the rest of the episode.

        A twist the servo can carry but that contact stops raises as well: the
        call ends with an error when the pads reach 128 N of normal force, the
        torque passes the task's over-torque limit, the axial load on the
        part's stop passes 180 N, the grasp drifts past 4 mm or tilts past
        10 deg, or the task is already in a latched failure.  An errored call
        is not a no-op: the stop is noticed at the end of an iteration, after
        the step that ran into it, so that step's effect on the part stands
        however few turns the call reports.  Only a servo refusal is decided
        before its own iteration is stepped, and unlike those stops it latches
        nothing by itself.

            object_name: The name of the object being held.
            angle_rad: (float) Total rotation angle in radians.

                planner sub-moves without a lead, servo iterations with one,
                each carrying angle_rad / steps of the twist.
            feed_lead_m: (float) Axial advance per full turn, in metres.  Its
                sign does not follow angle_rad: a positive lead descends the
                hand, a negative one lifts it, whichever way the twist goes.
