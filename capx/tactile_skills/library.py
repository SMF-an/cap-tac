"""Tactile skill library: reusable reading and acting recipes, routed by task.

Three things sit next to each other and say different things:

  * an API docstring says how to *call* a function;
  * a task PROMPT says what the task *wants*;
  * a skill says how to *find something out* -- which channel to read, what the
    reading means, what invalidates it, and which trap the obvious version
    falls into.

The third used to be paraphrased into every task PROMPT and every docstring
section separately, and the copies drifted: the same rule stated twice with
different thresholds, or with the numbers in one place and the caveat in the
other.  Here each skill is one markdown file under ``skills/<family>/``,
frontmatter naming the task types it applies to, so a task receives exactly
the skills its type routes to.

Not to be confused with ``capx.skills``, which extracts Python functions from
successful trial code -- this library holds prose, not code.

"""What a skill is for.

``sense``    turn the gel into a number: which channel carries it, what the
             reading means, what invalidates it, what it cannot tell you
``act``      what to do with the hand on the strength of a reading: approach,
             grasp, insert, turn, search
``place``    set a free object down, carry it, and confirm it stayed

A rule that spans two of these is filed by what it changes.  A reading that
exists only as the difference between two commanded states is still a reading,
and the motion a reading starts, stops or corrects is still an act.  The family
is bookkeeping for whoever maintains the library -- routing is by ``task_types``
and ``tasks`` alone, and the compact render does not name the family, so moving
a skill between them changes no prompt but one line's place.

Everything here is delivered to a task, so everything here has to be worth a
line of that task's prompt.  Disproved ideas are not: they are for whoever
writes the next criterion, they would never be routed anywhere, and they live
in `docs/univtac_tactile_skill_inventory.md` §4.5 instead.
